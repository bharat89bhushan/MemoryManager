# Memory Manager

## About this
The purpose of this project is to build memory manager that controls memory operations such as new, delete in C++ and malloc, calloc, free in C etc. These memory operation affects performace of an application.

## Directory structure
FixedSizeMemortMngr - consist of source code <br>
libs - consist of library can be used in any application <br>
interface - header file include in application <br>
samples - small code to show how to use library. see Makefile <br>

## Usage
Makefile is present in 'FixedSizeMemortMngr' directory. Run 'make' in 'FixedSizeMemortMngr' directory. 'libMemMngr.a' is then created in 'libs' directory. This library can be used in any application. Also include header file in application.<br> For more, to understand how to use library, go through samples.
